# LSTM-MLP Option Pricing Model

This project implements a hybrid LSTM-MLP neural network to predict option prices. It is built using PyTorch and designed to handle sequential features (like time series) and tabular inputs jointly.

## Features

- LSTM encoder for sequential financial indicators
- MLP for combining static and encoded features
- Gradient tracking, custom training loop, and Streamlit dashboard
